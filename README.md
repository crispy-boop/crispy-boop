and i really dont know how to code other than binding suff together with parethesis, /, :, and '.
but can someone tell me what this is?


For / each / vertex / vi, disti = (ni - ki Let / LBL / be / a / matrix / array / where / component / LBLi, j corresponds / to / vertex / vi / and / label `j . Initially, set
LBLi,j = |η
in
i (`
    j: operator(j) /
    config.data(FLAG = /true)
                while / F: LAG do
      Let vi be the element of V where disti is minimal.
    F LAG = (disti 6 = ∞) if F LAG then Remove vi from G
    for vj in η out i do
      for `q ∈ lf((vi, vj )) do
LBLj,q = LBLj,q − 1
if LBLj,q = 0 then
distj = distj − 1
end if
end for
If distj < 0 then distj = ∞
end for
end if
end while)
return(All nodes left in G)
